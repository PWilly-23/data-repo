            <p class="paraText">Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (stylized as CineMark) is an American movie theater chain that started operations in 1984 and since then it has operated theaters with hundreds of locations throughout the Americas and in Taiwan. It is headquartered in Plano, Texas, in the Dallas–Fort Worth area. It is the largest movie theatre chain in Brazil, with a 30 percent market share.

                Cinemark operates theaters under several brands, including its flagship Cinemark, Century Theatres, Tinseltown, CinéArts and Rave Cinemas.
                
                In May 2021, Cinemark struck agreements to show films from some of its major Hollywood studio partners, including Warner Brothers, Walt Disney, Paramount, and Sony. The goal of the move is to establish how long movies will play in theaters before being available for home video.</p>
